Quantower Time-Based Range Fibs

This indicator overlays time-specific price range boxes and Fibonacci retracement levels on your chart, designed to help traders identify key support and resistance zones based on specific trading sessions. It highlights price ranges formed during user-defined morning (default: 9:00–10:00 AM) and afternoon (default: 3:00–4:00 PM) sessions, with customizable Fibonacci retracement levels (30%, 50%, 70%) drawn from these ranges.

Key Features:

Customizable Sessions: Define morning and afternoon session times (e.g., 9 AM and 3 PM boxes) with adjustable time zones (e.g., America/New_York, UTC, etc.).
Range Boxes: Displays bullish (green) or bearish (red) boxes based on the session's candle direction, with options to toggle visibility and adjust transparency.
Fibonacci Levels: Plots optional 30%, 50%, and 70% retracement lines extending rightward from each box, with customizable colors and line styles.
Retracement Type: Choose between wick-based or body-based ranges for Fibonacci calculations.
Box Management: Limits the number of unmitigated and mitigated boxes (default: 3 each) to keep the chart clean, automatically removing older boxes as new ones form.
Alerts: Configurable alerts trigger when price interacts with Fibonacci levels, with a customizable message (e.g., "Price hit 50% fib level from Morning box").
Appearance Options: Adjust box colors, Fibonacci line colors, line width, and extension length for a tailored visual experience.
How It Works:

The indicator identifies the high and low of each session’s range and draws a box around it. Fibonacci retracement levels are calculated from the range and extended to the right for future price analysis. Boxes are classified as mitigated once price fully breaks through them, and the indicator dynamically updates their state while maintaining a user-defined maximum number of boxes on the chart.

Ideal for day traders and technical analysts looking to trade key intraday levels with precision and clarity.
